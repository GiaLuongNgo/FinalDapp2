AUCTION HOUSE

Auction house is a Dapp describe a real auction in our lives. Seller can set the intial price of bid. Bidder can input his bid and his bid must be higher than the intial price of seller. When another bidder input the higher bid price, this app will show the lastest highest bid. If no one has the higher bid than the lastest bid, the manager of this auction will close this auction and the contract's balance which is the lastest bid will be sent to the seller.

I have deployed this Dapp using firebase at this https://auctionhouse-8e53b.web.app/

I have deployed the smart contract on kovan testnet at 0x15CB856D4E3ABae770c1619070087EB7D1D7Fa6B


USE CASE

Blockchain is, indeed, perfectly relevant to my project as it answers some security requirements that traditional auctions can’t currently guarantee. They are not transparent. Bidders have no way to ensure the origin, authenticity and legitimacy of a higher bid. Yet, thanks to blockchain technology, bidding history is made trackable and verifiable by anyone.

Solution of Auction House is highest Price Wins. The Highest-Price-Wins property establishes that the bidder who submitted the highest valid bid is the one who wins the auction. If Alice (an honest bidder) places the highest bid, another bidder Bob must be unable to win the auction on his behalf on a bid lower than Alice’s.
